V0.0 : A working Android App controlling an electric guitar!

The Processing code in the android directory works with the Arduino Micro code in the micro_protocol_02 directory to collectively form the first major milestone of the project: A fully functional android app communicating with the Ibanez RG140 circuit. 

The circuit is controled by an arduino "Micro" and communicates via a JY-MCU bluetooth module.  
        
The Processing code is based on the linux python version in the linux directory. The Ketai Processing library is used for android and bluetooth support.
        
There are too many people to thank individually for all the help and support that they gave me during this work, but the core team of Blake, Enrico, Jean and Luis really made this project possible. The Brussels Hackerspace community also provided great ideas to advance the work.

My profound thanks to them and to all the others!
