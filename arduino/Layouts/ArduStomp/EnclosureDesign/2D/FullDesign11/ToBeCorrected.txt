Tod:
4. get the thickness of the 6mm plexi when it is available to be sure, my guess
   is that it, like the wood, is 6.2mm thick.

Done:
1. Fixed in FullDesign10_6mm_mirror_reverse13_laid_out.dwg 
   Check the engraved line on the back for millions of copies of the line,
2. Fixed in FullDesign10_6mm_mirror_reverse13_laid_out.dwg 
   fix the position of the neck middle and bridge labels,
6. Fixed in FullDesign10_3mm_text_all_arcs_mirror_15_Laid_out.dwg
   move the slot on the SD card reader plate forward 1.5mm.
7. Fixed in FullDesign10_3mm_text_all_arcs_mirror_15_Laid_out.dwg
   mark all arcs to id side!
9. Fixed:
   Remove bolt fittings from front an back panel.
10.Fixed in Plexi_6x6_2thick_v11_1.dwg
   reduce the height of front and back panel so no milling will be needed post
   laser cutting: this means offsetting the mark upwards, then trimming the
   original top sections so only the lowest horizontal line is the top.
8. Fixed in Plexi_6x6_2thick_v11_1.dwg
   set the length of the bolt slots to 16mm so that the bolts fit with no 
   cutting!!
   if they are all extended to 16mm, before offset, then 50mm long bolts fit
   the arcs (30+6+16 = 52 >50) and for the short ones, 16+6 = 22 > 20.
5. Done in the Arcs, worked perfectly! Plexi_3_target6x6_2thick_v11_1.dwg
   square hole units are components so they adjust automatically everywhere!
3. Done in both 6mm and 3mm files:
   Plexi_6x6_2thick_v11_1.dwg
   Plexi_3_target6x6_2thick_v11_1.dwg
   correct all the holes which depend on the width of the 6mm wood or plexi.
   - currently they are at 5.8 x 5.8 which makes 6.1 x 6.1.
   - they should be 5.8 on the cut side and 6.1 on the width side so as to
     obtain a final hole 6.1 x 6.4 for a peg 5.9 x 6.2.  So that means that
     the dimension before offset is 6 x 6.3 leading to 5.8 x 6.1 after offset
     leading to 6.1 x 6.4 after cut.

At cut time: 
1. Be sure that the text is backwards but upright.
2. Make one more test in 6mm & 3mm plexiglass, tiny small scale!
3. Use wood for the 6mm base, plexiglass everywhere else!

Now:
1. Done 2013 12 23
   pay for the work done
2. Done 2014 01 02:
   order 6mm & 3mm transparent plexi.

When the plexi has arrived:
1. measure the exact thicknesses to confirm the cut width.
2. make a test with both 6mm and 3mm to check the conforming.
2. remodel as needed.
