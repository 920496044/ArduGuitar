1. Fixed in FullDesign10_6mm_mirror_reverse13_laid_out.dwg 
   Check the engraved line on the back for millions of copies of the line,
2. Fixed in FullDesign10_6mm_mirror_reverse13_laid_out.dwg 
   fix the position of the neck middle and bridge labels,
3. correct all the holes which depend on the width of the 6mm wood or plexi.
   - currently they are at 5.8 x 5.8 which makes 6.1 x 6.1.
   - they should be 5.8 on the cut side and 6.1 on the width side so as to
     obtain a final hole 6.1 x 6.4 for a peg 5.9 x 6.2.
4. get the thickness of the 6mm plexi when it is available to be sure, my guess
   is that it, like the wood, is 6.2mm thick.
5. make all the square holes components so that they adjust automatically 
   as needed.
6. Fixed in FullDesign10_3mm_text_all_arcs_mirror_15_Laid_out.dwg
   move the slot on the SD card reader plate forward 1.5mm.
7. Fixed in FullDesign10_3mm_text_all_arcs_mirror_15_Laid_out.dwg
   mark all arcs to id side!

At cut time: 
1. Be sure that the text is backwards but upright.
2. Make one more test in 6mm & 3mm plexiglass, tiny small scale!
3. Forget about using wood, only one material: plexiglass

Now:
1. Done 2013 12 23
   pay for the work done
2. order 6mm & 3mm transparent plexi.

Whebn the plexi has arrived:
1. measure the exact thicknesses to confirm the cut width.
2. make a test with both 6mm and 3mm to check the conforming.
2. remodel as needed.
